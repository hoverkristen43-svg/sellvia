## How it works

Sellvia operates as a centralized system for managing dropshipping workflows. Store owners connect the platform to an independent ecommerce website and select products from an available catalog.

Orders placed by customers are processed through the platform, which handles fulfillment and shipping logistics. Product management, pricing, and order tracking are managed from a single dashboard.
